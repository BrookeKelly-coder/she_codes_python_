#Loops - repetitive tasks
#Loops - for loops and while loops
#For loops - are better to use if you know how many times to repeate a task
#While loops - better to use if don't know how many times to repeat action

#For Loops - sequence, Strings, lists, dictionaries

# for num in range(5):
#     print(num)

# for num in range(1,11):
#     print(num)

# for num in range(1,11,2):
#     print(num)

#the above example, is start at 1, stop at 10, and skip by 2)

#Excercises:
# Use a for loop to print numbers. 0-100 and 100 will be inclusive
# Use a for loop to print number 0-100, but skip 5 each time, 0, 5, 10, 15

# for num in range(0,101):
#     print(num)

# for num in range(0,101,5):
#     print(num)

# chilli_wishlist = ["igloo", "chicken", "donut toy", "cardboard box"]

# for item in range(len(chilli_wishlist)):
#     print(chilli_wishlist[item])

# #passing the list in - length of list, will return 4 this integer
# #this would be a range 4 & we called the variable name item
# # item ->0 we iterated through the list and printed the elements

# for item in chilli_wishlist:
#     print(item)

# #We could also right this in that way above

# #Excercise: Adapt the for loop to print a message
# #for each item in the list, e.g. "chilli wants: item"
# # use a for loop to print each item in a list from a previous exercise

# for item in chilli_wishlist:
#     print(f"Chilli wants: {item}") 

# names = ["Brooke", "Carlie", "Katie", "Stacey"]

# for name in names: 
#     print(name)

# chilli_wishlist = [
#     ["igloo"], 
#     ["donut toy" "tennis ball", "crocodile toy"], #toys
#     ["chicken", ["peanut butter"], #food
#     ["cardboard box", "kong", "dig mat"]
#     ]

# for category in chilli_wishlist:
#     for item in category:
#         print (item)
